        <p>Have you ever thought of going into Dev-Ops? Ever thought of all of the work that
goes into hosting and providing an application that is viewable all across the
globe, regardless of how many users are using the app at one time?
 Well that is what the Dev-Ops engineers work on,
all the time. The promise of serverless and event-driven architectures, which
is what Emit Conference was based on, takes this notion of Dev-Ops and
automates it. Instead of having to worry about how many servers or
instances to run when a spike in traffic hits your app,
serverless promises to &lsquo;run your servers&rsquo; i.e. use resources, only
when needed. Now, you may say, yeah sure, that seems logical enough, but
I tell you that it&rsquo;s a very new concept that has been brought into light with
Amazon Lambda in 2015. Google Functions, Azure Functions, and IBM Cloud Functions are
now quickly doing what Lambda did, but with slightly different variations. The
goal of this post will be to summarize what I learned at the one day conference
which brought leaders in Serverless, and event-driven architecture together,
and teach you about Serverless computing. Disclaimer:
the talks were very theoretical, so I am sorry if I do not do these talks justice.</p>

<p>The first talk was by&hellip;. from the Software Architect for Nordstrom. The basis
of his talk was about how he used Amazon Lambda and other services to run all
of the Nordstrom backend - comprising of millions of transactions a day. One of
the problems he faced when using this solution was that there was a certain
threshold that is set by Lambda for the number of actions that are possible in a
given time frame. There were certain times when he exceeded this threshold, and
he was limited by Lambda; the takeaway that I got from this talk was that
there are certain limitations to serverless, and that sometimes running things
on the cloud <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> might be a bit easier in terms of managing huge workloads. This
is definitely an over simplification of what happened in this use case, but again,
i&rsquo;m not going for a deep technical explanation of what the problem was - if you
are looking for that, please go ahead and ping our friend from Nordstrom.</p>

<p>The next speaker talked about the resources that are needed to enable an app to
run on event-driven architecture - containers.  The premise
of this talk was about the shift in the last few years away from Virtual Machines,
and to Containers. For those who need a refresher, or who simply don&rsquo;t know,
Virtual Machines are a way to get your code to run in a certain environment
without having the physical hardware to support that. Containers are a bit less
costly, so we have seen a big move towards this sort of architecture, especially
with the rise of Docker and Kubernetes. The example that was made from our friend
was that of a simple &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; app in Node.js. This is the really the baseline
here, since every Node.js app will have to use at least this much memory. Now, the
really interesting thing was that the Unikernel was more efficient than your
normal container in <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> metrics of memory usage - On disk image size, start up time,
and security vulnerabilities. The one part where Containers dominated Unikernels
was in Runtime Memory Overhead. This is really interesting, since all of
serverless is usually provisioned with Containers, so if we find another
environment that will be better suited for serverless, than we can find a lot of
solutions to some of the problems that we have had previously. Maybe even
solving the problems that our friend from Nordstrom had.</p>

<p>The next talk was by Austin Collins, the founder of Serverless. This was very
interesting since he was the Organizer of the event, and he really connected
a lot of the concepts that were talked about at the event. One of the interesting
things Austin talked about is the idea of servicefull - stringing together a
multitude of services on your serverless app to accomplish what you could with Cloud
but with a smaller cost. Now, what if you really like using Watson for Voice
Recognition, but you really like using Google&rsquo;s Machine Learning algorithms?
This is when you run into a problem with Serverless. Usually Serverless works
by using the service provider&rsquo;s physical resources: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or
IBM&rsquo;s servers. And these providers don&rsquo;t necessarily like each other. They won&rsquo;t
just let you mix and match services from different providers. But Austin saw a
problem, and went out to solve it. This is where Event Gateway comes in. It&rsquo;s a
way to be able to string together different services from different providers
in a easy way. With a software command line interface by Serverless, you can
finally get the best of both worlds - Google&rsquo;s Machine Learning algorithms, and
IBM Watson&rsquo;s Natural language processing. This is an extremely powerful
advancement in serverless computing since it will be easier to build that
end to end app, without the limitation of the big providers.</p>

<p>Another interesting talk was given by &hellip; from the Uber director. He talked about
building a completely serverless Platform that does not use a provider. The
problem with using AWS is that you will have to use their Data Centers, and Uber
did not want to give up that control. Instead they built their own catalyst. I
thought this was extremely interesting, since as an engineer, to be able to build a
whole system from scratch that is able to mimic an extremely complex and expensive
system is a huge accomplishment. Also, to think that their whole
infrastrucutre runs on demand - on a serverless environment is quite amazing.
They are definitely pioneers in this field, and can be used an example that
building this type of architecture is possible.</p>

<p>The event concluded with a Q/A session of a panel which consisted of
engineers from Google, Microsoft, and Garmin. The question that they were asked was
simple - what is the big value proposition of
this whole movement? The answer was unanimous: it really comes down to
the concept that there are less tech chores to worry about. The
actual provisioning of servers, instances, and memory allocation is something
that a data janitor typically does. I say that it&rsquo;s a janitors job simply because
it&rsquo;s not very exciting. With serverless, tech chores are like the iPod, a
thing of the past.
 With serverless, the promise of the future is getting to spend more time with the
client, or the actual
business logic that will be making revenue. The major use cases that we have
seen in this industry has come in from using Serverless as a backend for a
web applications. Another use case has come from academics - when huge amounts of processing
power needs to be used at once, in the case of a huge data set. This is a very
interesting use case, since it is very interspersed, and atypical.</p>

<p>Ok, so this is a very new and hot field. Just like Machine Learning, Artificial
Intelligence, and deep learning. But what is in store for the future of this
field? The biggest thing right now for the top providers is to streamline the
process of building out solutions using event-driven architecture. A big problem
right now is the lack of tools that are currently available. From my own experience,
it&rsquo;s extremely hard to debug when developing for Serverless, and you will have to
write the functions in one language, then modify your code to be able to adapt
to the Serverless syntax. The syntax usually pushes you to divide up your
logic into different functions that each use different services then string up
your functions together so that the output of one can be used as the input of
another.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the best way to get started? I&rsquo;m a big advocate of learning by doing. I
suggest to simply build out an existing app and change the backend to use
Serverless. That will give you the experience you need to get started in this
extremely new and exciting field.</p>
