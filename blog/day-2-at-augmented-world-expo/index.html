        <p>The second day at AWE proved to be really really incredible. The biggest difference
between the two days was that the Expo was open today, giving me the ability
to try out all of the cool gadgets and headsets that I learned about previously.
Some proved to be great, and others not so great. Ill give my thoughts on the
speakers that I saw from Meta, Schell Games, and Kopin Corporation, as well
as the products I tried out:</p>

<p>1) Meta 2
<br>
2) Microsoft HoloLens
<br>
3) Daqri SmartHelmet
<br>
4) ODG R8
<br></p>

<p>The first presentation I saw was by Meron Gribetz from Meta, so ill start there.
<hr></p>

<h4 id="setup">Meta</h4>

<p>Meron&rsquo;s presentation started a bit slow, as he went through the beginning stages
of starting his company, from a Kickstarter. As his
kickstarter started gaining ground, he was sitting in his dorm room in New York,
and saw that Steve Wozniak, Co-Founder of Apple, places an order for his product.
 Shortly after, Toyota does as well. After this, Meron started talking about what
he learned from his customers. An interesting fact that Meron alluded to was that
  85% of his customers wanted to use his AR product to increase productivity.
  Furthermore, another big problem that he faced with Meta was creating a new
  UI paradigm. He knew that he could not just simply import a 2D UI from the past,
  as Augmented Reality is all about coming up with 3D and immersive experiences.
  This is how he came up with his user requirements, and eventually, AirGrab.
  AirGrab is a patented gesture system to enable moving, scaling, and rotating objects in AR.
  When I saw the live demo of AirGrab on stage, I was in awe. For the first time
  in the event, I was completely blown away. First of all, it was a completely
  live demo, happening in real time. It was not a video like all of the previous
  presentations. It was happening in front of me. The first part of the demo was
  showing how the AirGrab worked. Basically, you reach out and grab the hologram
  of whatever you want in front of you, and a circle lights up. Once you are in
  the correct location to grab that item, the circle becomes a white color, and
  you know you can grab that object and move it around.</p>

<p><h5> AirGrab and Move </h5>
  <div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/nsEWakkK5lhsc" width="90%" height="90%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
  The weird part about it is
  that you see a bunch of static and blurred lines when you put your hand through
  the image. I did expect this, but it could be something that is improved:
  the smoothness of putting your hands through the hologram. Another amazing
  feature that Meron demoed was rotating and scaling objects. By grabbing objects
  with two hands, (first by holding you hands as if giving a high five, then
    making a fist with your hands), you are able to scale objects (holograms) to
  be bigger or smaller, just as if you were stretching or compressing a rag.</p>

<p><h5> AirGrab and Scale </h5>
  <div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/kEQFsaWOQoAfe" width="90%" height="90%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
This was incredibly impressive. But what was even more impressive, is the
  &ldquo;shelf&rdquo; idea that Meron presented. There was a 3D &ldquo;shelf&rdquo; where a bunch of apps sat,
  Gmail, Facebook, you name it. You can go ahead and grab those apps, display
  them in 3D, and click through them as if you were using a computer. The
  amazing thing is that you no longer need monitors&hellip;each different app
  like Gmail, or Facebook was like a physical &ldquo;monitor&rdquo;, and you could scale
  those monitors and move them around as you want, in 3D. It&rsquo;s really, really,
  revolutionary.</p>

<p><h5> AirGrab Browser Navigation</h5>
  <div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/uBHoDxYA3hjt6" width="90%" height="90%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
The actual spacial processing could use a little work, as in the
  demo, not even Meron, the CEO himself, could place the Gmail window above the
  Google Calendar window successfully. So there is some room for improvement there. Next, he went ahead and showed how to take a screenshot, which was
  definitely a very cool application, but was not as groundbreaking as some
  of the other features.</p>

<p><h5> Screenshot</h5>
  <div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/LHxqsZl2FGUCI" width="90%" height="90%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
   Now this is the real kicker. He saved the best for last.
  Meta2 is compatible with smartphones using a special app. With this app, you
  are able to save pictures and videos inside the app, and display them in
  AR with the AirGrab technology. To do this, you simply make a grabbing
  gesture over the smartphone, and the picture or video appears as a hologram
  almost instantly.</p>

<p><h5>AirGrab Video</h5>
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/rTF2fjGIHXlhS" width="90%" height="90%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
   Furthermore, once you are done viewing your video, you
  can push it back into the smartphone by grabbing it with one hand, and
  releasing right over your phone&rsquo;s screen. The compatibility with the
  smartPhone will be key for Meta and its future products. While there are
  a lot of areas for improvements, I do think the AirGrab itself is here to stay.
  The way to grab, rotate, and scale objects with two hands is very intuitive,
  and is a great interface for AR. I am extremely excited to see how much they
  can improve their product in the coming years.</p>

<p><h4 id="setup">Schell Games</h4></p>

<p>After Meron&rsquo;s presentation, I was still in awe, and I really did not think
anybody could follow up on what he demoed. But boy was I wrong. Although it did
take me a few minutes to get on board with Jesse, his high energy and sarcastic
jokes had me laughing the whole time. His presentation was focused on the concept
of what will the AR and VR systems look like in 2025. One of the most interesting
points that Jesse brought up was that he thinks that VR will dominate AR by 2025.
The points that Jesse brought up were very valid. Some of the biggest problems
in AR right now is the limited field of vision. In Jesse&rsquo;s demo, he shows
a video of someone using the HoloLens to interact with characters in AR but when
the user gets close to the character, the head gets cut off, and you cannot
fully see the character anymore because of the limited Field of Vision.
<iframe class = "scroll-wrapper" width="560" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7S7b3h5uOU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>I saw this problem with all of the AR headsets I tried, but primarily with the
DAQRI SmartHelmet, in that I had to physically hold my helmet a certain way to
see a clear hologram. Same with the HoloLens, but to a smaller extent, I kept
having to readjust the headset in order to be able to see the hologram clearly.
One of the most obvious points that Jesse brought was that nobody will
want to wear these crazy headsets. They look so dumb! I completely agree&hellip;I would
hope that designers can look into creating a more aesthetically pleasing product.
Another more subtle problem with the AR industry is privacy. If everyone
will be wearing these headsets around, and they can take videos
of others without anyone knowing, (Just like Meta showed), everyone will
feel like they are being watched. Nobody likes that. Jesse&rsquo;s biggest takeaway
was that instead of focusing on AR, he thinks that we should focus on VR. And not
only that, but we can focus on VR for kids. He thinks this is the market that
will have a breakthrough and will widely adopt this technology in the consumer
space. I don&rsquo;t know how parents will feel knowing that their kid is in Virtual
Reality most of the day, but I definitely don&rsquo;t like the sound of that. But,
on the contrary, I do think the kids from this generation onward will be playing in Virtual Reality and learning a lot from it. They will no longer be sitting in
front of an Xbox playing Call of Duty or Halo. They&rsquo;re going to be walking around,
and exploring in Virtual Reality. If we make games that are able to teach kids
useful concepts such as math, science, and other languages through the use of
immersive technology, I do think that parents will be ok with letting their kids
play in Virtual Reality.
Jesse didn&rsquo;t go too much into the
details of what his products will be like, but I am guessing he is developing
a whole suite of different educational and entertaining games designed for kids.
It&rsquo;s hard for me to comment on anything about his actual products but I do think
that he has a great understanding of the market and has a great vision for the
future of VR. Keep an eye out for Schell games&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="setup">Kopin Corporation</h4>

<p>John Fan, CEO of Kopin, had in interesting talk about what needs to be done
to be able to break into the AR industry and see it become widely adopted. A lot
of the speakers had similar themes, but I liked that John focused on the hardware,
which was a nice change from all of the software intensive products that were
showcased up to this point. John showed some of the successes of his company,
which have mostly come in the military industry. He has produced a line of
AR helmets which are used in the military and has captured almost all of the
market share in this space. The helmets superimpose important data such as
where fellow soldiers from your team are, where possible sources of danger are,
and other cool features. Another interesting field he has entered is coming up
with AR helmets for firefighters which uses thermal imaging to show where the
fire is the strongest and has the highest temperature. As you can imagine, this
can be extremely useful, especially in a high-risk situation such as evacuating
a burning building. The biggest problem that John addressed was that the helmets
for AR are currently to bulky, and that the optics is the problem. To this,
John has offered a Optical Module that he has built into eyeglasses, which
can display your smartphone screen by simply looking up.
<iframe class = "scroll-wrapper"width="560" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWlWaIhvERM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>From his video, this
looked super innovative, but the only problem I saw with this was the ability
to quickly turn this display off. If you see someone that you need to talk to
and you don&rsquo;t want to be looking at them through Google Maps, you would need to
be able to quickly turn the display on and off. Other than that, I think this
is a very nice product, and am looking forward to trying it out.
Transitioning into the VR space, John says that the biggest problem is seeing
lousy images in Virtual Reality. The proccessing power is not quite there yet,
and to be able to see extremely sharp images in a completely immersive
enviornment is a tough task to handle. Mr. Fan solves this problem by
creating his own OLED microdisply for VR systems. OLED provides the highest
resolution, fastest speed, and lowest energy requirements. He has many pattents
pending, and won an CES Innovation Award for his Lightning Technology as it
applies to VR systems. I do think that his hardware is quite revolutionary, and
I am sure we will be seeing much more of Kopin in the coming years when talking
about VR and AR.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="setup">ODG R8</h4>

<p>The R8 was a really nice product because it is so small and portable compared to
the other ones that I tried. While the field of vision is a bit small, (I had to
gaze up and down to see the full hologram), the image is pretty clear, and it&rsquo;s
easy to move around with the product since it is wireless. Overall, I think
these glasses are some of the best AR solutions we have on the market right now.</p>

<p><b>Rating: <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub></b></p>

<h4 id="setup">Meta 2</h4>

<p>The Meta 2 is very interesting. I would say that this is the coolest AR product
that I have seen at this conference, but there are definitely some problems
with the user experience. The one big problem I had with the AirGrab technology
is that there are times where it is hard to fully grab the hologram, and that
the spacial mapping seems a bit off. Sometimes it feels you must grab through
the object too deep in the Z axis, and it adds a weird feel to the product. The
actual imagery is really cool, in that you can have all of your displays out,
and can bring up vidoes from their app to your AR field of vision. Overall,
this product has the most potential from the AR products I have seen, but
the fact that it must be connected to a super powerful graphics processor is
a downside.</p>

<h4 id="setup">Microsoft HoloLens</h4>

<p>This product is really cool. It is wireless, and has really clean graphics.
The one problem that I had after trying this product on both Day 2 and Day 3
is that it feels heavy. The headset attaches to your forehead, and I felt the
weight of the device pulling down on my forehead, making it a bit uncomfortable.
Furthermore, the actual field of vision is very small, but the clarity of
the holograms does make up for this. For example, when I was viewing a demo
I would only be able to see about half of the hologram, and would have to
pan up and down with the HoloLens to view the full hologram. Below is a video
that shows others testing the HoloLens, and what holograms they would see with it on.</p>

<iframe class = "scroll-wrapper"width="560" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFYl7mT9UH8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I think this is
a great product, but the hardware could be improved a bit in order to make it a
bit more comfortable.

<p><h4 id="setup">DAQRI SmartHelmet</h4>
This one is very much a helmet. It is designed to be used in construction sites,
and is very bulky. The one problem I had with this device, which I dont know if
this was my fault or that the DAQRI representative didn&rsquo;t show me how to
properly wear the helmet, but I had to manually hold the visor closer to my
face to see the hologram. This was annoying, but overall, the graphics were
impressive, and it was synced to the IBM Watson IoT platform to deliver live
data which was pretty cool. Overall, the product did not have as good of graphics
as the HoloLens, but definitely got the job done. And for industrial settings, I
do think this could go a long way.<br />
