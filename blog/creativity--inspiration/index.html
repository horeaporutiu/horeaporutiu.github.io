        <p>So I just got back from my usual Saturday morning — a one hour tennis lesson followed up with dim sum and boba tea, but something felt different about this particular morning. I felt unusually inspired, and creative. That’s why I decided to sit down and document my thoughts. I feel like these moments happen so few and far between, that it’s incredibly important to actually take the time to write down what you are thinking in that moment. Most times I have these thoughts, I think to myself:</p>

<p><center><i><br>&ldquo;okay, that’s interesting, but I’ll just write that down later, and do it later.&rdquo;</i> </center></p>

<p>Yup, you guessed it. Later means never. My goal is to inspire you to simply take the time to bring your ideas and thoughts into reality.</p>

<p><center><img class = "pic" src="../../img/sock.jpg" alt="Mountain View" ></center></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how I felt before I started charging more for my tennis lessons. I was on the ground crying, ready to quit. I can’t do this anymore.
For example, I have been coaching tennis and charging the same usual rate for my morning tennis lessons. It’s been wearing me out a bit, and I have been thinking of simply cutting out lessons for a couple of reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>They take a lot of mental and physical energy — carry the basket of balls to the court, teach for an hour, walk back, shower, stretch. This takes about 2 hours in total each time, when you consider everything. I’m only getting paid for one hour. And that price really hasn’t increased much in years, whereas my coaching skill has naturally improved from having more experience.
<br></li>

<li><p>From the health and exercise standpoint, I could just go to the gym — I can run sprints on the treadmill, do weighted squats, bench press, and everything I want, but in half the time.</p></li>

<li><p>I’m not getting better at tennis. If I wanted to get better at tennis, I could just play with my roommate who was an NCAA All-American, or my other friends in the city.</p></li>

<li><p>I’m not making that much money. I’ve already covered this. For one hour, the pay is fine, but if you consider all the collateral, it’s more like two hours.
Then I caught up with an old friend from my college tennis team that still coaches. I told him what I was thinking and he just said, “yeah, just charge more until you’re satisfied.”</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And that’s what I did. There is really no crazy formula. Just charge what you think you deserve, and if the client wants to pay, then they will, if not, then cool, I have more free time. And now I’m happy.</p>

<p>How I feel after charging more for my tennis lessons.</p>

<p><center><img class = "pic" src="../../img/dimitrov.jpeg" alt="Mountain View" ></center></p>

<p>The benefits were really tremendous.</p>

<ol>
<li>I look forward to the tennis lesson since I think it’s benefitting me and my student more.</li>
<li>I do a better job because I want to be there. I feel like I should be giving a $ — quality lesson, which is higher than what I was getting paid before, so naturally my quality goes up.</li>
<li>I’m an overall happier individual. That’s good for not only me, but everyone that interacts with me. Nobody wants to hang out with a grouch.</li>
</ol>

So my take away is simple. If you are inspired, take the leap of faith. Was I nervous when writing this article? YES. I definitely thought halfway through that I should not post it. Why? Because I’m self-conscious. You are too. It’s part of being human. I think there are times in your life when you just naturally aren&rsquo;t that inspired. And that’s okay. That’s part of being human. But I say when you do find that time when you are inspired. That’s when you got to go. You can’t hesitate and be like:</p>

<p><center><i><br>&ldquo;okay, that’s interesting, but I’ll just write that down later, and do it later.&ldquo; — everyone that ever existed </i> </center></p>

<p>If you do that, you’re missing out on so much beautiful content and creativity that could really benefit you and everyone around you. That’s all i’m going to leave you with today. When you get that creativity flowing through your veins, you’ll know. Just use it, if not, you&rsquo;ll lose it. Also, one more thought. Change and being uncomfortable is good. My CEO ALWAYS SAYS THIS AND IT DRIVES ME NUTS. BUT IT’S TRUE. That’s why it’s annoying, because it’s true and I don’t want to believe it.</p>

<p><center><i><br>“Comfort and growth will never co-exist.&ldquo; — Ginny Rometty </i> </center></p>

<p>And look, it sucks. I want to be comfortable. You want to be comfortable. Everyone wants to be comfortable. But if you want to become a better person. You have to be willing to be uncomfortable. And it’s tough. If everyone could do it, then they would. But it’s hard. And you have to push yourself. But some of life’s best moments come from pushing yourself beyond what your own preconceived limits. So get out there and do it. Enjoy people.</p>
