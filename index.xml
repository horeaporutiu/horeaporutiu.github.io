      <description>Hey guys! I haven&amp;rsquo;t written in a bit since I was exploring some cool technologies. In the past week, i&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work learning about Kitura. In this blog, I will explain what I have learned, and help you get started learning Kitura and integrating your apps with Watson. Below is an iOS app that integrates text to speech and language translation services from watson. The source code to get started can be found here.</description>

      <description>In this blog, I will go over some of the basics of OpenWhisk and go over a simple example of an action that will load weather for your area. I assume you already have a Bluemix account. If you do not, go here to get one. 
Initial Setup 1) Setup OpenWhisk CLI (Command Line Interface). If you&amp;rsquo;ve verified your setup from the setup above, you should be good to go!</description>
